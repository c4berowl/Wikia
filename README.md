Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body, hoping to be wrong.<br>
Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind.<br>
New growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old.<br>
But what is wisdom?<br>
Is it poems written on a page?<br>
Is it actions done in my name?<br>
Is it words spoken on the wind?<br>
Wisdom is formless, for only the wind remains when all else is gone.<br>
