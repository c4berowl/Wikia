Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body, hoping to be wrong./n
Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind./n
New growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old./n
But what is wisdom?/n
Is it poems written on a page?/n
Is it actions done in my name?/n
Is it words spoken on the wind?/n
Wisdom is formless, for only the wind remains when all else is gone./n
