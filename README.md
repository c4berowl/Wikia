Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body, hoping to be wrong.
Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind.
New growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old.
But what is wisdom?
Is it poems written on a page?
Is it actions done in my name?
Is it words spoken on the wind?
Wisdom is formless, for only the wind remains when all else is gone.
