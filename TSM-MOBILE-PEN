Recon > Static Analysis > Dinamic Analysis > Reporting

# Recon:

# Fing information about the company
- Earnings Reports and press releases often contain info about mobile apps
# Find the target app on the Play Store or Apple Store
- Read reviews
- Enumerate who created the app
- Enumerate the different app versions and patch notes
- Enumerate the company's other apps

# Static Analysis

# Reading the application code via manual or automated tools to assess the security
- Looking for hardcoded strings, security misconfiguration, or additional targets extracted from the app

# Static analysis will sometimes results in the pentesting process being triggered, especially additional enumeration or fingerprinting
# Find a URL - Recon, enumerate, exploit etc.
- Many companies use other API gateways/path for mobile apps vs the traditional website
# Find an email/username - recon using phonebook.cz, etc.
# Find a storage bucket - recon, enumerate with cloud_enum
